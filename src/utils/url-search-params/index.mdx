# Working with `URLSearchParams`

<Meta title="Utils/URLSearchParams" />

The `URLSearchParams` interface defines utility methods to work with the query string of a URL. It is common for
web applications to use this interface to parse and manipulate the query string of a URL, particularly to store
application state like the filters applied on a list page.

It's valuable to store specific pieces of state in the URL because users should be able to:

- Refresh the page or navigate through their browser history without losing their state;
- Open links in a new tab using their OS' standard keyboard shortcut and reliably see the state they expect; and,
- Share and bookmark links within a web application and have that link open to the same state as when the link was
  copied.

See [MDN's URLSearchParams documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) for
more details and usage examples.

Unfortunately, the `URLSearchParams` interface can be a bit awkward to work with. The following utility functions
are provided to smooth over some of its rough edges:

- [toMap](?path=/docs/utils-urlsearchparams-tomap--docs): Converts a `URLSearchParams` object to a `Map`, ensuring that multiple values for the same key are stored as arrays.
- [toURLSearchParams](?path=/docs/utils-urlsearchparams-tourlsearchparams--docs): Converts iterable of key-value pairs to a `URLSearchParams` object.
