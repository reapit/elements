# Working with Breakpoints

<Meta title="Utils/Breakpoints" />

Elements defines a standard set of breakpoints that can be used to create responsive designs. The minimum width of
each breakpoint is defined in the `BreakpointMinimumDimensions` object available via `@reapit/elements/utils/breakpoints`.

Elements also provides utility functions to help create conditions based on these breakpoints. These functions can be
combined with [MatchMedia](?path=/docs/utils-matchmedia--docs) or [useMatchMedia](?path=/docs/utils-matchmedia--docs) within
your JavaScript code, or directly in styled components using Linaria's `styled` utility.

For example, in JavaScript code:

```tsx
import { isWidthAtOrAbove, isWidthBelow } from '@reapit/elements/utils/breakpoints'

// true when width >= BreakpointMinimumDimensions.SM
const isWidthAtOrAboveSM = useMatchMedia(isWidthAtOrAbove('SM'))

// true when width < BreakpointMinimumDimensions.MD
const isWidthBelowMD = useMatchMedia(isWidthBelow('MD'))
```

Or in a styled component:

```tsx
import { isWidthAtOrAbove } from '@reapit/elements/utils/breakpoints'
import { styled } from '@linaria/react'

const MyResponsiveDiv = styled.div`
  background-color: blue;

  /* Equivalent to "@media (min-width: 1024px)" */
  @media only screen and ${isWidthAtOrAbove('MD')} {
    background-color: red;
  }
`
```
