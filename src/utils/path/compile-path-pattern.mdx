# compilePathPattern

<Meta title="Utils/Path/compilePathPattern" />

Compiles a path pattern into a regular expression that can be used to match real pathnames. Path parameters in the pattern (e.g., `:id`) become named capture groups in the regular expression, allowing their values to be extracted from matched pathnames.

The splat (*) parameter, if present in the pattern, will always be the last capture group. It is not be available as a named capture group.

The compiled regular expression is always case-insensitive.

## Syntax

```ts
compilePathPattern(pattern)
```

- `pattern`: The path pattern to compile into a regular expression. Should not have a trailing slash.

Returns a `RegExp` object that can be used to test and match pathnames against the compiled pattern. Named parameters become named capture groups, and splat parameters become positional capture groups.

## Example

```ts
import { compilePathPattern } from '@reapit/elements/utils/path'

const regex = compilePathPattern('/users/:id')

// Test if a pathname matches
regex.test('/users/123') // => true
regex.test('/users') // => false
regex.test('/posts/123') // => false

// Path parameter available as a named capture group
const match = '/users/123'.match(regex)
if (match) {
  console.log(match.groups?.id) // => '123'
}
```
