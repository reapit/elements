# Chip

Similar to the chips used on the `MultiSelect` component, the underlying element is a HTML checkbox, allowing for them to be used in a form and with form libraries.

They are used to toggle filters and the state of pages on click or on form submit.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={ChipStories.BasicUsage} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={ChipStories.BasicUsage} />

## Chip Group

A group of Chips has it's own wrapper to display responsively in a CSS grid.

<Canvas of={ChipStories.ChipGroupUsage} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={ChipStories.ChipGroupUsage} />
