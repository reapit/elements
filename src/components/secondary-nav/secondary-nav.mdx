# SecondaryNav

A secondary navigation component for rendering sub-pages.

> When using the `SecondaryNav` ensure you add your nav options (or sub-options) to the main `Nav` component in mobile view, since this component will be hidden below tablet resolution. See main `Nav` docs for more.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas>
  <Story of={SecondaryNavStories.BasicUsage} />
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup component="SecondaryNav" story="Basic Usage" />

Supply as children, as many `<SecondaryNavItem>` tags as required.

## SecondaryNavItem

Use `SecondaryNavItem` as a child of `SecondaryNav`. It accepts the following props, as well as any other standard HTML or React attribute for `<div>`, e.g. `onClick`

## React example with `useState`

The props accepted by the `SecondaryNavItem` are below - the `SecondaryNav` itself only accepts standard HTML attributes.

<ArgsTable of={SecondaryNavItem} />

<Canvas>
  <Story of={SecondaryNavStories.ReactExample} />
</Canvas>
