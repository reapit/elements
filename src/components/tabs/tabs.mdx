## Tabs

The `Tabs` component uses an underlying radio button to manage toggling without JavaScript. As such, you can manage state using any Form library or by referencing the `onChange` input event.

As always, for non React users, you can just apply the classes in the rendered markup to your input and label elements.

Typically you will use this component as a tertiary in-page navigation.

## Styles Only Usage

<Canvas of={TabsStories.StylesOnlyUsage} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={TabsStories.StylesOnlyUsage} />

## Full Width

Slight variation on the above where the Tabs spans the full width of it's container.

<Canvas of={TabsStories.FullWidth} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={TabsStories.FullWidth} />

## No Border

Another variation on the above where the Tabs have no bottom border.

<Canvas of={TabsStories.NoBorder} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={TabsStories.NoBorder} />

## React Usage

The React component does not render children, rather it accepts a list of options and maps through them on render.

Props available for the React version of the component;

<Controls />

Where `TabsOption` is defined as;

<Source
  code={`
export interface TabsOption {
  id: string
  value: string
  text: string
  isChecked: boolean
}
`}
  language="tsx"
/>

<Canvas of={TabsStories.ReactUsage} />

## React Full Width

Slight variation on the above where the Tabs spans the full width of it's container.

<Canvas of={TabsStories.ReactFullWidth} />

## React Uncontrolled

Simple example demonstrating how to transition content using tabs. In practice, you may want to dispatch to a router or similar.

The underlying radio buttons are uncontrolled by default so the `isChecked` is used to set the `defaultChecked` in this example. This is to allow the radio to behave nativele i.e. it will update the state using the `onChange` event but not vice versa.
