# PageHeader

Really a collecation of previously defined components, but exported as a React shorthand for a best practice pattern to display at the top of each page. Should always sit within a `PageContainer` see layout for more details.

If you want the page header to have a max width and center on the page in desktop, add the `hasMaxWidth` prop to the `PageHeader` component.

All props are optional, with the exception of `pageTitle` - see the individual component docs for more information on the available options however, we advise sticking largely to the template below.

<Controls />

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={PageHeaderStories.BasicUsage} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={PageHeaderStories.BasicUsage} />
