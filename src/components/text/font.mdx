# `font`

Many components with Elements need to apply font styles based on a specific size and weight. The required styles will
be specified within Figma for each component and will look something like the following CSS:

```css
/* text-sm/Regular */
font-family: var(--font-sm-regular-family, Inter);
font-size: var(--font-sm-regular-size, 14px);
font-style: normal;
font-weight: var(--font-sm-regular-weight, 400);
line-height: var(--font-sm-regular-line_height, 20px); /* 142.857% */
letter-spacing: var(--font-sm-regular-letter_spacing, -0.14px);
```

When an engineer uses this CSS, they will simply copy and paste it into their styled element verbatim, then remove the
CSS variable default/fallback values. The problem with this is we duplicate a lot of font-related CSS throughout many
components, which increases the cost of change, especially if we go through another CSS variable overhaul.

To ease this cost, we have a `font` CSS style helper that can be used. With this helper, instead of duplicating the CSS
from Figma, an engineer will do the following:

```ts
// styles.ts
import { font } from '#src/components/text'

const MyStyledDiv = styled.div`
  ${font('sm', 'regular')}
`
```

This will generate the same CSS as shown in the first snippet, with the exception of `font-style` (generally, we want
to inherit `font-style` rather than force it to be `normal` in all cases).
