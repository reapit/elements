# Menu

The Menu component is a panel used to display a list of buttons and/or anchors which can be ordered in Menu Groups

Each Menu Group can have a title shown above the list

More features will be added to Menu in the future

<Controls />

## Default

By default, the `Menu` is left-aligned, but this can be adjusted using the `data-alignment`. Additionally (for React user), the vertical position of the Menu is automatically adjusted based on the available space below the trigger and `window` each time the menu is opened (can use `yOffset` to have more adjustment).

`closeMenu`={false} can be set to keep the menu open when it is clicked.

Note: `closeMenu` and `yOffset` are react only props.

## With Alignment

Example for `Menu` with right Alignment.

<Canvas of={MenuStories.WithCustomAlignment} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={MenuStories.WithCustomAlignment} />
