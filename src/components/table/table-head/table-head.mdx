# TableHead
This story demonstrates how to use the `TableHead` component in a basic table setup. It shows the table header with 5 columns, including a checkbox, text, and image headers.
The `TableHead` component is used to define the header of the table. It typically includes `TableHeaderCell` elements that represent the table column headers.
You can combine it with other components like `Table`, `TableBody`, and `TableToolbar` to create a fully functional table.

## Basic Display With Sticky Header
