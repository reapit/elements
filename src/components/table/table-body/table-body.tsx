/**
 * The `TableBody` component is an essential part of a table structure,
 * serving as a container for table rows (`TableRow`).
 * Each row inside a `TableBody` typically consists of one or more `TableCell` components.
 *
 * ## When to Use
 *
 * - To display structured data inside a table.
 * - When working with dynamic data sets that require programmatically rendered rows.
 * - As part of a tableâ€™s body section, following the `TableHead` component.
 *
 * ## Basic Structure
 *
 * A typical table implementation consists of:
 * - `TableHead`: Defines column headers.
 * - `TableBody`: Contains the main data rows.
