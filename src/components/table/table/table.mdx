# Table

The `Table` component is a flexible and structured way to display tabular data. It consists of multiple subcomponents, including `TableRow` and `TableCell`, allowing for fine-grained customization.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

For **non-React users** and **React users with basic needs**, the table can be constructed using presentational components:
- `TableContainer`
- `TableToolbar`
- `Table`
- `TableHead`
- `TableHeaderCell`
- `TableBody`
- `TableRow`
- `TableCell`

These components ensure a consistent and accessible table structure. Non-React users can refer to the rendered HTML markup for implementation details.

<Canvas of={TableStories.BasicUsage} />
<Controls />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={TableStories.BasicUsage} />

### Advanced Usage (For React Users)

For **React users**, additional features enhance the tableâ€™s functionality, such as:
- Expandable **Call-to-Action (CTA)** containers
- Interactive table behaviors

While these advanced features offer more flexibility, the core `Table` component and its children are sufficient for most use cases.
