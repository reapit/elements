# Table

## Summary

The Table component can be used in 2 main ways within

1.  Building a table from the Table molecule components, e.g. `TableRow`, `TableCell`, etc
2.  Using the React shorthand and supplying a `rows` prop with data. This way offers advantages such as not needing to manage the state for the expandable rows.

There are two visual styles for the table, dependant on screen width.

1.  Normal
2.  Narrow - i.e. where the screen is too small for the content on a conventional screen - below 1024px.

On the Narrow version, the table's grid switches to a 2 column layout. There are additional modifiers that can then be
applied to cells when it's in narrow mode, e.g. showing the header within the cell and whether a cell should be full width.

## Basic Usage

For Non React users and React users with basic requirements, you can just use `Table`, `TableHeadersRow`, `TableHeader`, `TableRow` and `TableCell` components as presentational components to render your content. See the rendered Markup for non-React users as always.

In addtion, you can split the space available vertically with the `TableCellSplit` component. We also support images and form controls like checkboxes being inserted into cells.

For React users, the table has a number of freatures that you may find useful to present your data, like an expandable call to action container. These do fall under the banner of "Advanced usage", so in most cases, just use the basic table component classes and render children to get the desired functionality for your application.

## Column widths

The `Table` is a CSS Grid to support proper resposiveness. By default the number of columms is set to the number of Cells in the first row and all columns are the same width. If you want to override this, set the `data-num-columns-excl-action-col="8"` property on the `Table` element to a desired number of columns, then add an appropriate `elSpan2` `elSpan3` etc class to the relevant `TableCell` elements as per below.

<Canvas of={TableStories.ColumnWidths} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={TableStories.ColumnWidths} />

`Table` only renders children, unless the `rows` prop is supplied as a React shorthand.

## Basic Customisation - Table Cells

`TableCell` renders children, but also accepts some other props. Any other props given that aren't listed below are are applied to the underlying `div` element.

Props available for the React version of the component;

{/* <ArgsTable of={TableCell} /> */}

To explain these props;

- `icon` Adds an icon at the start of the cell
- `darkText` Turns the cell's text colour to black to make a cell's content appear bold
- `narrowLabel` Set a label that will be shown within a cell, when the table is in narrow view mode. **You may need to make your screen smaller to see this story.** Non-React users, note that a data attribute is set `data-narrow-label`.
- `narrowIsFullWidth` If set, this prop will ensure that in narrow view mode the cell takes up both columns of a table.
- `narrowOrder` If you require to change the order of your cells in the mobile/narrow view, you can use the `narrowOrder` property to change the cell's order in the column. The order can be specified between 1 and 12. For non-React users you can also use the classes `el-table-cell-narrow-order-1` through to `el-table-cell-narrow-order-12`.

As always, these modifiers map to CSS classes for non React users.

In the example below, you can see examples of all the different flavours of `TableCell` and modifier. It is worth re-sizing the screen to see the 'narrow' behaviour.

## Expanding Table Cell Space

It is quite common that you will find table data taking up much more than the available space than your table has available. In this instance, you can force the table into "mobile mode" to allow multi-line rows for the table.

This is done by adding the `data-force-narrow-table='true'` attribute to the main wrapping `Table` (`.el-table`) element.

## Trigger Cells

Typically with a table, you will want to perform an action on the data as displayed in a given table row. We offer two distinct UI patterns to achieve this;

1.  A collapsable container - used when there is more than one call to action required or if there is some more complex behaviour to render like an edit form.
2.  A call to action cell - used when there is a single action to perform, for example a button that triggers a navigation or a dialogue window to open.

The below two examples show the additional markup required firstly, to show an expandable container and secondly, a call to action cell.

For the call to action, you will need to add your own action to toggle the `isOpen` modifier or the underlying `.el-is-active` class for non-React users.

For all users note the data attributes applied to the table.

- `data-num-columns-excl-action-col` Should be the number of expected table columns, less the call to action cell.

#### Expandable version

For this version the `data-has-expandable-action` attribute should additionally be applied to show the call to action column.

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={TableStories.ExpandableContent} />

#### Call to action version

For this version the `data-has-call-to-action` attribute should additionally be applied to show the call to action column.

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={TableStories.CallToActionContent} />

## React Shorthand

When using React, we can achieve the same effect using the shorthand "rows" prop. We also handle expand and contract behaviour of the expnadable content for you as well as addigng the relevant data attributes.

To understand the options available, it is worth looking at the available props of the relevant components.

The `rows` prop consists of a list of cells as well as optional `expandableContent` and `ctaContent` props.

Options for a cell are shown below and map to the keys in the cells array.

<Source code={`
export interface CellProps {
  label: string // The header label
  value: string // The cell content
  children?: ReactNode // Children to render if required
  icon?: IconNames // An icon name if required
  className?: string // Any custom css class for the cell
  statusCircleIntent?: Intent // If there is a status cell, what intent should it have
  cellHasDarkText?: boolean // Should the cell have dark text for emphasis
  narrowTable?: NarrowOptionsType // Narrow table options see below type
}

export type NarrowOptionsType = {
  showLabel?: boolean // Should the header be shown as a label when in narrow mode
  isFullWidth?: boolean // Should the cell be full width in narrow mode
  order?: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 // The grid order of the cell when in narrow  mode
}
`} language="tsx" />

For `expandableContent` and `ctaContent` the interface is the same;

**Only one of `expandableContent` and `ctaContent` should be used - the table will only expect one to be supplied**

<Source code={`
export interface RowActionProps {
  content?: ReactNode // The main content for an expandable cell, not relevant to a CTA
  cellContent?: ReactNode // The trigger cell's content - defaults to an icon
  headerContent?: ReactNode // The header's content - defaults to an icon
  onClick?: () => void // Optional click event. This will override the default "open expandable" behaviour so typically, for use with the CTA variant
  className?: string // Any custom css class for the cell
  icon?: IconNames // An icon to render in the cell if no cell content supplied
}
`} language="tsx" />

## Advanced Customisation - React

For React users, we also expose some advanced customisation options via prop modifiers. These allow us both to control the number and span of columns as well as override the default toggle behaviour for expandable content. See below for the available options;

<Controls />

To explain these props;

- `rows` A list of table rows - when using this React shorthand, the label is used as the header and value / or children can be specified to render content. See table cells below for other options.
- `numberColums` The table defaults to fill the available space evenly for each column. If you want to customise this, increase the number of table columns and add a column span modifier as a className to your table cell. E.g. by increasing the number of columns by one more than the number of cells then applying an `elSpan2` className to one cell, this cell will span two columns.
- `indexExpandedRow` See expandable content below. This allows you to programatically toggle open a row's expandable content by passing the row index as a prop. The default React behaviour handles a toggle onClick however, you may wish to override this for example, when you wish to close a row on an API callback or form submission.
- `setIndexExpandedRow` See above, if you are using your own expanded row state, pass your setter (eg a React useState setter), to the component so that the on click expansion keeps your `indexExpandedRow` in sync.

In the below example we pull this behaviour together by adding an extra column to the table to allow more space for the "property" column. To do this, we also add a custom `elSpan2` class, imported from the `Grid` component. See the `Grid` story for available span props, or write your own custom class that adds a desired column span eg `grid-column-end: span 2;`

We also specify that the first row is expanded by passing an `indexExpandedRow` prop and control this using `useState`, passing the setter as a `setIndexExpandedRow` prop. As per above explanation, this is useful if you want to expand and collapse your expandable rows, depending on some condition rather than a simple `onClick`.
