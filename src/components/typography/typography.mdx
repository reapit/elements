## Modifiers

We support a number of modifier to override the default typography, specifically bold, italic, grey coloured and centered text. Also, removing the bottom margin when you want to manually group your text items and adding a bottom margin for denoting the end of a page section.

See the table below for details of these modifiers - these all map to css modifier classes you can add to your HTML markup.

<Controls />

In all cases they map to css classes you can see in the rendered markup. Below you can see each of the modiifiers applied to a title and a body text component. They are available also for small text and subtitle.

## Intent

As with numerous other components, we support the concept of intent. This is a modifier that allows you to set the colour of the text to match the intent of the content.
