# Dialog

The Dialog component that renders a dialog box that overlays the main screen. It is typically used for displaying confirmation or error notifications to users that require an addtional call to action or step.

## Basic Usage

The Dialog is built on top of the `dialog` HTML element and is therefore accessible to screen readers.

To open the dialog, you must use the `showModal` method on the dialog element and avoid using the open prop.

To close the dialog, you must use the `close` method on the dialog element.

By default, the dialog fills it's current container so you will likely wish to place it as high as possible up the DOM tree to achive an overlay effect.

Dialog has two sizes, small and medium, which are applied to the `dialog` element. The small is used by default due to its suitability with mobile-first sizing.

To use the medium size, you can add the `data-size="medium"` prop to the dialog element.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.BasicUsageSmall} story={{ height: '200px' }} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={DialogStories.BasicUsageSmall} />

## Medium size

The medium variant is the default size and is suitable for displaying more complex content. It offers a larger viewing area than the small variant.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.BasicUsageMedium} story={{ height: '200px' }} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={DialogStories.BasicUsageMedium} />

## React usage

The React component accepts props to toggle the classes that control whether the dialog is opened or not.

Props available for the React version of the component;

<Controls of={DialogStories.ReactUsage} />

<Canvas of={DialogStories.ReactUsage} story={{ height: '300px' }} />
