# Layouts

When thinking about laying out your page, you will need to wrap your content in a series of Containers. To support out common patterns, will first introduce some new container components.

The components themsleves are really around laying out a page so you may want to skip forward to the full examples below.

## MainContainer

In this example you can see the `MainContainer` component - used to wrap the whole application and will handle the `Nav` and main content positioning.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayoutStories.MainContainerUsage} />
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup component="Layouts" story="Main Container Usage" />

## SecondaryNavContainer

The `SecondaryNavContainer` is fixed width and used to contain secondary navigation as well as controls like filters.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayoutStories.SecondaryNavContainerUsage} />
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup component="Layouts" story="Secondary Nav Container Usage" />

## PageContainer

The `PageContainer` should be the body of your content, it will typically contain a `Grid` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayoutStories.PageContainerUsage} />
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup component="Layouts" story="Page Container Usage" />

## Page Container Max Width

The `PageContainer` should be the body of your content but maxes out at 1200px width when the `hasMaxWidth` prop is applied in Desktop and is centered on the page.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayoutStories.PageContainerMaxWidth} />
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup component="Layouts" story="Page Container Max Width" />

## Has Grey Background

All containers accept a `hasGreyBackground` prop which will add a grey background to the container to support white tile on grey background layouts

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayoutStories.HasGreyBackground} />
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup component="Layouts" story="Has Grey Background" />

## FlexContainer

The previous two containers are postioned using the `FlexContainer` component. This component has a number of optional props to perform most flexbox operations - see the below inteface for React users:

<ArgsTable of={FlexContainer} />

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayoutStories.FlexContainerUsage} />
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup component="Layouts" story="Flex Container Usage" />

## Combined Container Components

In this example you can see the `MainContainer` component - used to wrap the whole application and will handle the `Nav` and main content positioning.

The `SecondaryNavContainer` is fixed width and used to contain secondary navigation as well as controls like filters.

The `PageContainer` should be the body of your content, it will typically contain a `Grid` component.

The previous two containers are postioned using the `FlexContainer` component. This component has a number of optional props to perform most flexbox operations - see the below inteface for React users:

These booleans map 1:1 to the flexbox helpers you can see here on [Github](https://github.com/reapit/foundations/blob/master/packages/elements/src/styles-v3/base/flexbox.ts). For the output helper classes, see the HTML Markup Component below.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayoutStories.CombinedContainerComponents} />
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup component="Layouts" story={['Combined Container Components']} />

## Combined Layout

For a complete example of how to lay out a page, see below where we have combined a number of other stories including `Nav`, `PageHeader`, `SecondaryNav` and `Grid` to give a full page layout.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayoutStories.CompleteCombinedExample} />
</Canvas>

{/* // <RenderHtmlMarkup
//   component="Layouts"
//   story="Complete Combined Example"
// />  */}

{/* ## Combined Layout Max Width

Variant on the complete layout but using a max width container in desktop, a side column and no secondary nav.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayoutStories.CompleteCombinedExampleMaxWidth} />
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup
  component="Layouts"
  story={['Complete Combined Example Max Width']}
  label="Complete Combined Example Rendered HTML markup"
/> */}
