# Layouts

When thinking about laying out your page, you will need to wrap your content in a series of Containers. To support out common patterns, will first introduce some new container components.

The components themsleves are really around laying out a page so you may want to skip forward to the full examples below.

## MainContainer

In this example you can see the `MainContainer` component - used to wrap the whole application and will handle the `Nav` and main content positioning.

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.MainContainerUsage} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={LayoutStories.MainContainerUsage} />

## SecondaryNavContainer

The `SecondaryNavContainer` is fixed width and used to contain secondary navigation as well as controls like filters.

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.SecondaryNavContainerUsage} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={LayoutStories.SecondaryNavContainerUsage} />

## PageContainer

The `PageContainer` should be the body of your content, it will typically contain a `Grid` component.

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.PageContainerUsage} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={LayoutStories.PageContainerUsage} />

## Page Container Max Width

The `PageContainer` should be the body of your content but maxes out at 1200px width when the `hasMaxWidth` prop is applied in Desktop and is centered on the page.

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.PageContainerMaxWidth} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={LayoutStories.PageContainerMaxWidth} />

## Has Grey Background

All containers accept a `hasGreyBackground` prop which will add a grey background to the container to support white tile on grey background layouts

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.HasGreyBackground} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={LayoutStories.HasGreyBackground} />

## FlexContainer

The previous two containers are postioned using the `FlexContainer` component. This component has a number of optional props to perform most flexbox operations - see the below inteface for React users:

<Controls />

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.FlexContainerUsage} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={LayoutStories.FlexContainerUsage} />

## Semantic Layout

Layout elements with semantic tags passed via the tag prop.

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.TaggedLayouts} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={LayoutStories.TaggedLayouts} />
