# Modal (Deprecated)

The modal component renders a dialog box that overlays the main screen. It is typically used for displaying confirmation or error notifications to users that require an addtional call to action or step.

## Deprecation Notice

The `Modal` component is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. We strongly recommend transitioning to the more versatile and feature-rich [Dialog](/docs/components-dialog--docs) component for creating dialogs in your applications

### Why is `Modal` being deprecated?

- The `Dialog` component offers a more comprehensive set of features, including customization options, and accessibility enhancements
- Using the `Dialog` component aligns with our commitment to providing a consistent and modern user experience across our product line

### Key Differences and Considerations:

While both `Modal` and `Dialog` components are used to display overlay content, the `Dialog` component offers a more flexible and customizable approach

**Structure:**

- Modal: A simpler structure with a single container for content and actions
- Dialog: A more structured approach with separate components for header, body, and footer, allowing for more flexibility and customization

**Props:**

- Modal: Typically uses props like `isOpen`, `onClose`, `title`, and `children`
- Dialog: Passes the `isOpen` prop to control visibility and utilizes `Dialog` structure components (`Header`, `Body`, and `Footer`) for content and actions

## React Code Example: Migration from `Modal` to `Dialog`

### Before (Modal)

```tsx
import { Modal } from '@reapit/elements'

const MyModal = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <>
      <ButtonGroup>
        <Button intent="secondary" onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>
          Open Modal
        </Button>
      </ButtonGroup>
      <Modal isOpen={modalIsOpen} onModalClose={() => setModalIsOpen(!modalIsOpen)} title="Welcome to the demo modal">
        <TextBase>Here's some nice content for the inside of the modal.</TextBase>
        <ButtonGroup>
          <Button intent="secondary" onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)}>
            Cancel
          </Button>
          <Button intent="primary" onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)}>
            Close
          </Button>
        </ButtonGroup>
      </Modal>
    </>
  )
}
```

### After (Dialog)

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@reapit/elements'

const MyDialog = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <>
      <ButtonGroup>
        <Button intent="secondary" onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>
          Open Dialog
        </Button>
      </ButtonGroup>
      <Dialog isOpen={isOpen} title="Welcome to the demo dialog" onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}>
        <Dialog.Header>
          <Dialog.Title>Welcome to the demo dialog</Dialog.Title>
        </Dialog.Header>
        <Dialog.Body>
          <TextBase>Here's some nice content for the inside of the dialog.</TextBase>
        </Dialog.Body>
        <Dialog.Footer>
          <ButtonGroup>
            <Button intent="secondary" onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)}>
              Cancel
            </Button>
            <Button intent="primary" onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)}>
              Close
            </Button>
          </ButtonGroup>
        </Dialog.Footer>
      </Dialog>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Styles Only Usage

The Modal component can be used for UI purposes only, but won't have the functionality of the React implementation (i.e. managing the state of whether it is open or closed)

If using the Modal component like this, you will need to toggle the `elIsActive` / `el-is-active` class to show/hide the modal.

This class must be applied on two elements, `div.el-modal-bg` and also `div.el-modal`, when you want the modal to be shown.

By default, the modal fills it's current container so you will likely wish to place it as high as possible up the DOM tree to achive an overlay effect.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.StylesOnlyUsage} story={{ height: '300px' }} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={ModalStories.StylesOnlyUsage} />

## React usage

The React component accepts props to toggle the classes that control whether the modal is opened or not.

In React world, you will likely want to trigger the modal using a portal (see our `Portal` component), so it can be rendered at the top level of your app and provide an overlay effect. Probably you will `useState` to toggle the hide and show behaviour.

This example gives maxmum flexibility but for the 'batteries included' approach, you should look at the `useModal` hook below.

Props available for the React version of the component;

<Controls />

<Canvas of={ModalStories.ReactUsage} story={{ height: '300px' }} />
