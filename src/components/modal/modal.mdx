# Modal

The modal component renders a dialog box that overlays the main screen. It is typically used for displaying confirmation or error notifications to users that require an addtional call to action or step.

## Basic Usage

The Modal component can be used for UI purposes only, but won't have the functionality of the React implementation (i.e. managing the state of whether it is open or closed)

If using the Modal component like this, you will need to toggle the `elIsActive` / `el-is-active` class to show/hide the modal.

This class must be applied on two elements, `div.el-modal-bg` and also `div.el-modal`, when you want the modal to be shown.

By default, the modal fills it's current container so you will likely wish to place it as high as possible up the DOM tree to achive an overlay effect.

Modal has two variants, small and medium, which are applied to the `div.el-modal` element. The medium is used by default.

To use the small modal, you can apply the `elModalSmallVariant` / `el-modal-small-variant` class to the `div.el-modal` element.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.BasicUsage} story={{ height: '300px' }} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={ModalStories.BasicUsage} />

## Small variant

The small variant is suitable for displaying brief messages or simple forms. It has a compact size and is ideal for non-critical information.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.SmallVariant} story={{ height: '300px' }} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={ModalStories.SmallVariant} />

## Small variant without title

<Canvas of={ModalStories.SmallVariantWithoutTitle} story={{ height: '300px' }} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={ModalStories.SmallVariantWithoutTitle} />

## Medium variant

The medium variant is the default size and is suitable for displaying more complex content. It offers a larger viewing area compared to the small variant.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.MediumVariant} story={{ height: '300px' }} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={ModalStories.MediumVariant} />

## Medium variant without title

<Canvas of={ModalStories.MediumVariantWithoutTitle} story={{ height: '300px' }} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={ModalStories.MediumVariantWithoutTitle} />

## React usage

The React component accepts props to toggle the classes that control whether the modal is opened or not.

In React world, you will likely want to trigger the modal using a portal (see our `Portal` component), so it can be rendered at the top level of your app and provide an overlay effect. Probably you will `useState` to toggle the hide and show behaviour.

This example gives maxmum flexibility but for the 'batteries included' approach, you should look at the `useModal` hook below.

Props available for the React version of the component;

<Controls of={ModalStories.ReactUsage} />

<Canvas of={ModalStories.ReactUsage} story={{ height: '300px' }} />
