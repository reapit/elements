# Steps

Used to indicate position in a process. There are two flavours of steps - the basic one is inline, for use as progress indicator or to toggle a transition between elements. The second is vertical and allows content to be inserted alongside each step - useful for vertical in page wizards.

Props available for the React version of the basic inline `Steps` component.

## Basic Steps Usage

<Canvas of={StepsStories.BasicStepsUsage} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={StepsStories.BasicStepsUsage} />

{/* <ArgsTable of={Steps} /> */}

Set the `selectedStep` prop to control the Steps component.

Steps that exist before the currently selected step are given an additional class of `.el-is-used` which gives the step a different background color.

A CSS transition occurs when moving between steps.

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={StepsStories.MiddleItemSelected} />

You can use any number of steps and you can also use letters instead of numbers. You can use any string as the content really.

Be aware though, steps with long text **aren't supported** and will not render very well at all.

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={StepsStories.LastItemSelected} />

## React example with `useState`

In the react example we have used the `useState` hook to keep track of the current selected step, passing the setter to the component so that the transition can be managed onClick.

## Steps Vertical

The vertical steps component lays the steps to the right of content containers. In the example, we use the `useState` hook to hide and show each step onClick. The HTML container as always, shows the rendered markup for non React users.

The available React props are;

{/* <ArgsTable of={StepsVertical} /> */}

Were `StepsVerticalStep` is defined below;

<Source code={`
export interface StepsVerticalStep {
  item: string
  content?: ReactNode
}
`} language="typescript" />
