# Mobile Controls

The `MobileControls` component provides a mechanism to render a floating button at the bottom right of the screen for controls typically hidden in mobile e.g. those rendered in the `SecondaryNavContainer` (See Layout Story).

By default the controls are only shown below a resolution of 768px however you can override this by setting the `isVisible` prop.

You can either use the component as a regular floating button to trigger an action like opening a `Modal` or navigating by setting the `buttonOnClick` prop.

Passing a list of `MobileControlItem` objects as per the example will render a list of items above the button you can assign actions to.

Finally you can upfate the icon on the button by passing any `IconName`.

## Basic Usage

<Controls />

<Canvas of={MobileControlsStories.BasicUsage} story={{height: '300px'}} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={MobileControlsStories.BasicUsage} />
