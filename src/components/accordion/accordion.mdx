# Accordion

An accordion component allows collapsable content where space is at a premium, for example mobile views. It is often used in conjunction with the `Drawer` component for small edits and quick views to avoid navigating and losing context in your app.

To open the accordion for vanilla usage, you will need to both toggle the `elIsActive` class on the content div and switch the `down` icon for `upSystem` - see the different states below.

## Styles Only Usage

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.StylesOnlyUsage} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={AccordionStories.StylesOnlyUsage} />

## React Usage

<Controls />

The React version of the Accordion handles the toggling of active classes for you. The props accepted by the `AccordionItem` are below along with the `AccordionItemProps` interface.

<Source
  code={`
export interface AccordionItemProps {
  title: string
  titleItems?: ReactNode[]
  content: ReactNode
}
`}
  language="typescript"
/>

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.ReactUsage} />
