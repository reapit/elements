# Top bar

Top bar component is part of the element's navigation, It is composed of several components to easily create a top navigation structure.

## Default

To display `TopBar` with vanilla usage, you will need to compose your component using `.el-top-bar, .el-top-bar-main-nav, .el-top-bar-search, .el-top-bar-secondary-nav, and .el-top-bar-profile` classes or respective component for each class for React usage as the example below.

<Canvas of={TopBarStories.Default} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={TopBarStories.Default} />

## React Usage

In the React usage, you can utilize `CSSContainerQuery` component to conditionally render the Main navigation section based on the viewport size, as demonstrated below (on wider screens all buttons should visible).

<Canvas of={TopBarStories.ReactUsage} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={TopBarStories.ReactUsage} />
