# Migrating to v5

In most cases, each v4 icon has been replaced with a direct equivalent, only instead of all icons being available via
a single `Icon` component, they are now available as individual components. For example, where the star icon was
previously used by doing:

```tsx
import { Icon } from '@reapit/elements'

const starIcon = <Icon name="star" />
```

It is now available as:

```tsx
import { StarIcon } from '@reapit/elements/icons/star'

const starIcon = <StarIcon />
```

This allows for more granular control over bundle size, as only those icons explicitly imported and used will be included
in the final bundle. To ease the migration path for v4 consumers with extensive icon usage, the v4 `Icon` component is
still available, but has been renamed to `DeprecatedIcon`, and will be removed in a future version.

A small number of v4 icons have been removed entirely, with no equivalent replacement available through the new v5 icons.
The v5 icons also introduce a number of new icons that were not available in v4. The following table lists all the icons
that have been removed or added in Elements v5.
