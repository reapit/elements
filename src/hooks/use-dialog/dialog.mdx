# Dialog

The dialog component renders a dialog box that overlays the main screen. It is typically used for displaying confirmation or error notifications to users that require an addtional call to action or step.

## `useDialog` API

Exports the following properties as an array, with the following indexes:

- `0`: `FC<Partial<DialogProps> & { footerItems: DialogProps['footerItems'] }>` - a React component that should be placed somewhere with the component that you want to use the dialog. Will pass props to the underlying dialog.
- `1`: `() => void` - a method that will open the Dialog.
- `2`: `() => void` - a method that will close the Dialog. The Dialog can also be closed by default from within the Dialog, or by tap an "Escape" key.
- `3`: `boolean` - convenience boolean to check if the dialog is open currently.

## Basic Usage

By default, the dialog fills it's current container so you will likely wish to place it as high as possible up the DOM tree to achive an overlay effect.

## React usage - Complete example with `useDialog` hook

The `useDialog` hook exports both a dialog component and state helpers for toggling the component open.

## Multiple `useDialog` hooks

Props available for the React version of the component;

If using multiple dialogs within a component, ensure you're using the unique variablesfrom `useDialog` to avoid conflicts, e.g. `const [ DialogA, openDialogA ] = useDialog()`
