We are also open to feature requests - in the same way please request [here](https://github.com/reapit/elements/issues/new?assignees=&labels=needs-triage%2C+feature&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=) - if it makes sense with our roadmap and the wider design system, we will accept for development.

## Version History

We will publish release version history and changes here. Where possible, we will adhere to Semver versioning.

Beta versions should be relatively stable but subject to occssional breaking changes.

### **5.0.0-beta.53 - 22/09/25**

- **feat:** Allow MMI product to display in the AppSwitcher
- **feat:** Allow Reapit Sales product to display in the AppSwitcher

### **5.0.0-beta.52 - 17/09/25**

- **feat:** Added Figma Code Connect for majority of core components.
- **chore!:** The colour prop for `Avatar` now accepts `'default' | 'primary'` instead of `'default' | 'purple'`;
- **chore!:** Renamed `FeaturesItem` to `FeatureItem`. If consumers are using `Features.Item` or the common items like `Features.Bedrooms`, this change will have no impact.
- **chore!:** Renamed `breadcrumbs` prop on `PageHeader` to `navigation` to better align with Figma component.
- **fix:** Fixed incorrectly defined entry points for lab and utils.

### **5.0.0-beta.51 - 12/09/25**

- **chore:** Implemented new component interface pattern that allows prop interfaces to be accessed directly from the component name, rather than requiring the use of `ComponentProps` or a separate import. That is, instead of using `import type { MyComponentProps } from ...` or `ComponentProps<typeof MyComponent>`, you can simply use `MyComponent.Props`. The existing component props are still available, but have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
- **chore!:** Moved `MobileNavItem` from `@reapit/elements/core/mobile-nav-item` to `@reapit/elements/lab/mobile-nav-item`. It is no longer available via the root `@reapit/elements` entry point. All styled elements and class names related to the component have been renamed to use `ElExperimental` and `elExperimental` prefixes; e.g. `ElMobileNavItem` -> `ElExperimentalMobileNavItem`.
- **chore!:** Renamed all class names involved in existing Lab components to use the `ElExperimental` and `elExperimental` prefixes.
- **fix:** Added missing `@reapit/elements/lab/*` entry point to package manifest ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- **chore!:** Align `TagGroup` and `ChipGroup` interfaces:
  - `ChipGroup` no longer supports `overflow: 'scroll' | 'wrap'`. Instead, it now supports `flow: 'wrap' | 'nowrap'` and `overflow: 'auto' | 'hidden'`. To migrate, `overflow="scroll"` becomes `flow="nowrap"` and `overflow="auto"`, while `overflow="wrap"` becomes `flow="wrap"` (the default).
  - `TagGroup` now supports `flow: 'wrap' | 'nowrap'` and `overflow: 'auto' | 'hidden'` as well.
- **chore!:** Enhance the DOM structure of `ChipGroup` to match `TagGroup`. Specifically, `el-chip-group` has been removed, with chip group now rendering directly as a `<ul>` rather than a `<div>` with a `<ul>` child.

  - `TopBar.NavSearch`, a responsive helper for correctly rendering the search button and search icon item across mobile and wider screen sizes;
  - `TopBar.NavSearchButton`, a simple button that should be used to launch the search experience on tablet and wider screen sizes;
  - `TopBar.NavSearchIconItem`, a thin wrapper around `NavItemIcon` that should be used to launch the search experience on mobile screen sizes.
  - Consumers using just `NavSearchButton` will no longer see a responsive change to the icon item version on mobile screen sizes.
- **feat!:** Renamed `NavSearch`, `NavSearchButton` and `NavSearchIconItem` components and styled elements to have a `TopBar` prefix.

  to the imported SVG. This is a breaking change that impacts all SVG imports. To minimise impact, the v4 `Icon` component has been updated
  to apply these attributes itself, but there may be other SVG usage in some components that will experience visual regressions if they were
  dependent on this automatic behaviour of the SVGR plugin.
- **chore:** deprecated `ReapitLogo` component. Will be removed in v5 stable.
- **chore:** update CSS variables to match latest Figma variables

**Major Release - UI Refresh**

The UI of Elements has undergone a full refresh to align the Reapit Group of companies around a common design system. In all components this means;

- A new color palette
- A new default Font Family - Inter rather than PT Sans
- Adjustments to spacing and sizing of components
- New logos and some new iconography

Additionally, there are multiple significant changes in this release however, for the majority of users upgrading from v3.x.x, these should be visual and cosmetic. There will be some UI adjustments undoubtedly required but we have tried to keep these to a minimum and it should be a case of validating your app and making appropriate light touch tweaks.

No functions, CSS classes or React props have been removed however, many have been deprecated. In all cases where there has been a deprecation, React there are console warnings and nothing will be removed that will break your build until the next major release v5.

#### Key components that have changed:

- `Button` is now only available in `primary`, `default` and `danger` intents. Buttons also no longer support fixed width, specific sizing and chevron variants.
- `Card` component now supports an avatar or image option to better display visual graphics. Cards also no longer support a context menu.
- `Nav` component now sits horizontally at all resolutions rather than as a side bar. This may break some layouts where a secondary nav is used however, this can be fixed by adjusting the flex-direction property on any inner containers used. The `MainContainer` change should fix this issue for most users.
- `Nav` icons have been largely deprecated.
- `Grid` and `FormLayout` components have smaller gutters and margins for a more compact UI.
- `BodyText` and `SmallText` components are slightly smaller in font size.
- `Icon` new modern icon set added. Infographic, system, solid system and menu icons to be deprecated at v5 - legacy components and graphics have been themed to reflect the new color palette.
- `Input` fields have a subtly different look and a new error state.
- `intent` props have been changed - `scondary`, `critical` and `low` are deprecated and `pending`, `warning` and `default` have been added. In all cases, new colors have been used to reflect intents.
- `Icon`, `StatusIndicator`, `PersistentNotification`, `Snack` and other components that use the `intent` prop have been updated to reflect the new color palette and intent names.

#### New components

- `Drawer` - slide out for rendering forms, tabs and 'quick view' content. Has `useDrawer` hook for programmatic control that works similarly to the useModal hook.
- `FormSectionDivider` - to break up complex forms by section - see `FormLayout` for revised suggested layout.
- `Accordion` - to allow users to expand and collapse content where space is at a premium.
- `Tag` - visual indicator tag to alert users to status of actions or items.
- `Badge` - low impact visual indicator.
- `Chip` - like a standalone version of `MultiSelct`, a checkbox chip for toggling state or filters.
- `ContainerProps` and `ContainerFlexProps` now support both `hasGreyBackground` and `hasMaxWidth` modifiers to support white tile on grey background UIs. Also, when not using a `SecondaryNav` it may be desireable to restrict the max width of the desktop page. This container prop fulfils this requirement - see layout docs for more info. See `Layout` stories for more detail.
- `Grid` - adds `GridThirds`, `ColSplitThird` && `ColSplitTwoThirds` components to allow for side bar and main content layouts. See above, best paired with a `hasMaxWidth` container.
- `Grid` - adds `ColHalf` and `ColQuarter` components to allow for more flexible granular layouts.
- `Tile` component added as an alternative to `Card` for laying out page sections. Works in conjunction with new container and grid items above.
- `Typography` extended with a much larger range of text sizes, addtional modifiers and supports the concept of intent across all text options.
- `Avatar` component added to support user profile images in `Card`, `Nav` and `Table` components. Has an image variant to allow property images and similar in thumbnails.
- `KeyValueList` component added to support displaying a record like a contact or property with or without a grid.
- `Table` adds key value cell, `Input` and image support with example code.
- `Table` adds a `TableCellSplit` component to allow for two rows supported in the same table cell.
- `BreadCrumb` component added to support navigation of a hierarchy of pages.
- `PageHeader` convenience component added to assist with page layouts.
- `Button` can now have `buttonSize` and `buttonIcon` props to allow display of icons (including icon only buttons) and sizing according to the standard style guide button sizes. By default, buttons remain responsive in mobile and desktop.
- `Nav` now supports new `Avatar` and `AppSwitcher` options for React users.

We hope the migration process will be relatively smooth in virtually all cases however, if you feel you need any support, please reach out to us via Github Issues in the normal way.
