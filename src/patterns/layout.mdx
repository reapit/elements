# Layouts

When thinking about laying out your page, you will need to wrap your content in a series of Containers. To support out common patterns, will first introduce some new container components.

## Combined Layout

For a complete example of how to lay out a page, see below where we have combined a number of other stories including `Nav`, `PageHeader`, `SecondaryNav` and `Grid` to give a full page layout.

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.CompleteCombinedExample} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={LayoutStories.CompleteCombinedExample} />

## Combined Layout Max Width

Variant on the complete layout but using a max width container in desktop, a side column and no secondary nav.

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.CompleteCombinedExampleMaxWidth} />

<RenderHtmlMarkup of={LayoutStories.CompleteCombinedExampleMaxWidth} />
